    text: `<p>Remember those brief, blissful weeks at the beginning of the summer? Vaccination rates were rising, COVID-19 infections were dropping and mask mandates were lifting. Lots of us started to cautiously hug our friends, eat in restaurants and plan vacations again. We thought we were seeing the end of the pandemic.
        <p>
            As it turns out, we were wrong. The Delta variant and vaccine hesitancy have combined to launch another surge in COVID-19 infections. And along with that comes another surge in mental health challenges related to the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
            Navaid Khan, MD, a Banner Health psychiatrist, explained what’s different about this latest surge and how we can care for our mental health as this pandemic continues unabated.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span><b>Make plans to help ease your uncertainty</b></span><br>
            “The biggest frustration people are facing now is a lack of knowledge,” Dr. Khan said. “There’s a lot of uncertainty.” We don’t know when the pandemic will end. We don’t know if new variants will pose a threat. We don’t know if the people around us are vaccinated. We don’t know whether our kids will stay in the classroom or switch to remote learning. We don’t know when or if we’ll have to return to working in offices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Persistent uncertainty can make you not want to plan, since you’re not sure you’ll be able to carry out those plans. But this lack of planning adds to your stress levels. “We need to accept that our new normal may be living in a pandemic,” Dr. Khan said.
        </p>
        <p>
            He said making plans, with the appropriate safeguards, can help reduce your stress. “Do not postpone things in your life thinking once the pandemic is over, you’ll do them,” he said. “You need to live your life the way it is now and plan things with the proper precautions.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Having something to look forward to can help alleviate stress and break the monotony of living through the pandemic. He recommends planning travel and vacations as long as you’re vaccinated, while avoiding crowded indoor activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span><b>Recognize that you might develop compassion fatigue</b></span><br>
            Frontline workers are prone to compassion fatigue, and these days we’re all at risk for its burnout, detachment and low productivity. That’s because we’re dealing with the never-ending stress of the pandemic. Vaccinated people may find themselves frustrated with unvaccinated people and no longer able to sympathize with people who are sick or even dying.
        </p>
        <p>
            Talking about your feelings can help you cope with compassion fatigue and regain your sense of empathy. “A lot of people thought that by not discussing it, they would forget it or it would go away,” Dr. Khan said. “That’s not true. The answer is to turn to the people around you. The way to deal with trauma is to talk about it. Emotional fatigue can only go away when you process it.”
        </p>
        <p>
            <span><b> away from the news and social media</b></span><br>
            To feed our desire for knowledge, we turn to the news or social media with a type of compulsion. “We want to stay away, but we can’t, and it feeds our anxiety,” Dr. Khan said.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try setting a time for news and social media and then stepping away. A quick daily check of the headlines or a few minutes of TV news can catch you up on anything important.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you compulsively check social media, try limiting yourself to just one platform instead of looking at four or five different apps. And restrict the time you use social media. “Don’t check it at work. It’s not meant for work,” Dr. Khan said.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span><b>Turn to the tried-and-true stressbusters</b></span><br>
            You’ve heard it before, but it’s worth repeating. Certain actions are practically guaranteed to reduce your stress as long as you make time for them. “It’s about finding a ritual that’s meaningful to you,” Dr. Khan said. Try:
        </p>
        <p>
            “Low-grade” exercise. Dr. Khan recommends moving your body with activities like yoga, stretching, swimming or walking outdoors. You don’t have to join a full-court basketball game or complete a triathlon to get the stress-reducing benefits of exercise.
            Breathing. When you’re stressed, your breathing becomes shallow and rapid. Taking a few slow, deep breaths can signal to your body that you’re okay and help you calm down.
            Meditation. Meditation is another proven stress reliever. Sit in a quiet room, close your eyes and focus on your breathing for three minutes to start. If sitting still isn’t working for you, try taking a short, slow walk where you focus on your footsteps, the sensations in your body or the sounds around you.
            Sleep. Getting enough sleep and following some simple sleep hygiene rules goes a long way toward reducing anxiety and improving motivation.
            And be sure to avoid excessive use of alcohol, nicotine or cannabis. They can worsen anxiety and depression and increase your heart rate and restlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span><b>Seek professional help if you need it</b> </span><br>
            These strategies might help you get your pandemic fatigue under control. But they might not be enough. If you’re not able to process your feelings, struggle to sleep at night, feel a sense of impending doom, or feel sad every day, it’s time to see a mental health professional. “When it’s beyond you and you’re not dealing with it well, it’s time to see a counselor,” Dr. Khan said. He points out that counseling alone, without medication, can usually help with mild to moderate symptoms.</p>

    text: `<p>COVID-19 has put into question every aspect of our daily routine and put “stay healthy” at the top of everyone’s to-do list. Our lives are different, in ways the world never imagined. So, with health set as a priority, how has flu season changed? We spoke with two Banner Health experts to discuss how flu season is different, and how it is the same, as we continue to battle the pandemic.</p>

        <p>“This has been an important 18 months for education,” remarked Brandie Beuthin, RN, a regional director of infection prevention at Banner Health in Arizona. “As we learn to live with COVID-19 in our day to day lives, we have seen how vaccination, masking and social distancing can keep rates of new infections low. In areas where vaccination uptake is low and masking/social distancing are not widespread practice, we’ve seen new rates of infections skyrocket (an enormous stress on our health care system and burned out health care workers). Utilizing these same behaviors to limit influenza infection is more important than ever to decrease the risk of illness and death in the geriatric and pediatric populations, prevent additional stress on the health care system and our health care workers.”</p>
        
        <span><b>Protect Yourself from Infection</b></span>
        <p>Precautions for the flu have not changed, and the best ways to protect yourself from infection are the same as they’ve been in prior years. Beuthin recommended a few necessary steps to lower your risk:</p>
        
        <li>Get vaccinated by the end of October, at the latest</li>
        <li>Wear a mask</li>
        <li> Wash or sanitize your hands often</li>
        <li> Maintain social distancing guidelines</li>
        <li> Stay home if you are sick</li>
        <li> Get proper sleep, diet and exercise</li>
        <br>
        <p>“If these flu prevention recommendations look familiar, there’s a good reason,” said Beuthin. “The flu spreads in the same way that COVID-19 can, primarily by tiny droplets made when people with the flu cough, sneeze or talk.” Social distancing and other necessary mitigation tactics have disrupted nearly every aspect of our lives since the beginning of the pandemic, but a silver lining is that the same practices can minimize spread for influenza as well.</p>
        
        <span><b>Flu Vaccination</b></span>
        <p>The influenza vaccine is a proven and necessary asset. It is among our strongest tools in our annual fight against the flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend an influenza vaccination annually for every individual 6 months and older.</p>
        
        <p>“Although COVID protocols have shown us how to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including social distancing, this does not mean you should skip the flu vaccine this year, even if you work from home or rarely leave the house,” said Beuthin. “In fact, the CDC has updated all flu vaccines to protect against four different flu viruses and can be given at the same time as a COVID-19 vaccine.” </p>
        
        <p>Devin Minior, MD, is a medical director at Banner Urgent Care. He provided some insight and debunked common myths regarding the flu vaccine. “Staying safe from the flu is more important than ever. Help keep you and your community safe by getting the flu shot in September or October, before flu season starts in November.”</p>
        
        <span><b>Flu Vaccines are Safe. Even During COVID-19.</b></span>
        <p>“There has been no study connecting the flu shot or other vaccines with an increased risk of COVID-19,” stated Dr. Minior. He went on to correct another misconception. “The flu vaccination does not temporarily increase your chance of contracting the influenza virus. The flu shot uses only pieces of the influenza virus, not the whole virus itself to help the immune system recognize and block it when it tries to enter your body. The nasal spray has a live virus, but it has been changed so it can’t cause the influenza disease. After getting the shot, mild symptoms such as soreness, redness, or swelling at the injection site can occur. A headache or low-grade fever may occur as well.”</p>
        
        <span><b>Influenza vs. COVID-19</b></span>
        <p>Both cause respiratory illnesses, and because many of the symptoms are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and testing may be needed to help confirm your diagnosis. Common symptoms shared by COVID-19 and influenza include:</p>
        
        <li>Fever or feeling feverish/chills</li>
        <li>Cough</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
        <li>Sore throat</li>
        <li>Congestion or runny nose</li>
        <li>Muscle pain or body aches</li>
        <li>Headache</li>
        <li>Some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children than adults</li>
        <li>Symptoms of COVID-19 that are different from flu may include change in or loss of taste or smell.</li>
        <br>
        <p>Those most at risk for severe influenza infection are children, pregnant women, elderly, those with underlying chronic medical conditions and those who are immunosuppressed. For the alpha variant of COVID-19, those older in age and/or with underlying conditions were at a significantly increased risk of severe infection. However, the age group primarily affected by the Delta variant (now the most common variant in the United States) is individuals 20-59, as well as increasing cases in children under 12 that cannot currently be vaccinated. One of the most significant reasons for this shift in the age affected is the high rate of vaccination in the older age group and in those with underlying conditions.</p>
        
        <p>If you have been on the fence about getting the COVID-19 vaccine because of the emergency use authorization, the Pfizer vaccine has now been fully approved by the FDA. It is now more important than ever for everyone who is able to get vaccinated for both the flu and COVID-19 to do so as soon as possible. </p>
        
        <span><b>If You Are Sick</b></span>
        <p>If you get sick with flu symptoms, in most cases, you should stay home and avoid contact with other people except to get medical care. For certain people at high risk of serious flu-related complications (including young children, people 65 and older, pregnant women and people with certain medical conditions), it is best to visit your doctor early in the illness. Dr. Minior added, “Early treatment with antiviral medications may benefit high risk people if started within two days after the onset of illness.”</p>

    text: `<p> If you can barely remember the last time you felt energized all day and ready to tackle whatever came your way, a health condition might be causing your fatigue. Different health conditions can sap your energy, leaving you feeling sluggish and listless, and one of them is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also called myalgic encephalomyelitis.</p>

        <span><b>What is chronic fatigue syndrome?</b></span>
        <p>CFS is a long-term condition characterized by fatigue that worsens with exertion and makes you feel so tired that you can’t complete normal, daily activities, but does not improve with rest.</p>
        
        <p>CFS is more common in younger and middle-aged women, but people of any age or gender could develop it. Genetics may also play a role.</p>
        
        <span><b>Symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome</b></span>
        <p>If you have CFS, you might have these symptoms:</p>
        
        <li>Fatigue that doesn’t let up with rest or sleep</li>
        <li>Feeling extremely tired after exercising</li>
        <li>Trouble concentrating</li>
        <li>Headaches</li>
        <li>Joint pain</li>
        <br>
        <p>Harvey Hsu, MD, medical director at Banner - University Medicine Internal Medicine Clinic in Phoenix, AZ, said, “It can be difficult to know if you have chronic fatigue syndrome since fatigue is a very common symptom.”</p>
        
        <p>If you feel moderate or severe fatigue for at least six months, talk to your health care provider. You’ll need to rule out other causes of long-term fatigue, such as low thyroid levels, low red blood cell counts, autoimmune disease, depression and sleep apnea.</p>
        
        <span><b>What causes chronic fatigue syndrome?</b></span>
        <p>Dr. Hsu said several conditions could trigger CFS, including infections such as mononucleosis, autoimmune disorders and an altered immune system that makes it difficult to fight off an infection.</p>
        
        <p>Many people who have been infected with the COVID-19 virus feel fatigued for a long time, and Dr. Hsu predicts that many will meet the criteria for CFS once six months have passed.</p>
        
        <span><b>Preventing and treating chronic fatigue syndrome</b></span>
        <p>You can reduce the likelihood you’ll develop CFS by taking care of your health, sleeping enough and avoiding infections.</p>
        
        <p>If you’re diagnosed with CFS, improving your sleep, treating any mood disorders and managing pain can help. Physical therapy can help some people, and cognitive therapy can help if you have trouble concentrating. CFS is rarely fatal, and some people recover spontaneously.</p>
        
        <p>“Each person is different, so it is important to learn your limits and pace yourself with exercise and any activity,” Dr. Hsu said. “Trying to push yourself can cause exhaustion and make your symptoms worse.”</p>
        
        <p>There’s a lot of misinformation about treatments for CFS. “Antibiotics, special diets, vitamin supplements and steroids have not shown consistent benefit,” Dr. Hsu said.</p>
        
        <p>“There is hope for better treatments for CFS in the future,” Dr. Hsu said. And since people recovering from COVID-19 sometimes develop CFS, there are new opportunities to learn about the disease.</p>`,

    text: `<p>Is your social media feed more packed these days with photos of dinner dates, get-togethers and trips to the beach? It seems like everyone is out from isolation living their best lives again, yet here you are on your couch in your home not quite ready for it all.</p>

        <p>These days, we’re still navigating COVID-19, variants, vaccinations and minimizing the spread, but many people have welcomed back some ‘normalcy’ in their lives—everyone, it seems, but you. Back to normal was all you dreamed about for months (or a year!). You don’t want to miss out on get-togethers with friends or eating inside at your favorite restaurants again, but you feel uncertain, even downright anxious.</p>
        
        <p>You have FOMO, fear of missing out, but in this case, it’s missing out on normal life. FOMO isn’t something new, but it does look a bit different these days.</p>
        
        <span><b>Why FOMO got worse during the pandemic</b></span>
        <p>“FOMO comes mainly from comparing ourselves with others; what others have and what we don’t,” said Jerimya Fox, a licensed professional counselor and a doctor of behavioral health at Banner Behavioral Health Hospital. “Pre-COVID, you may have experienced FOMO when someone got promoted and you didn’t. Today, people are experiencing FOMO as they see others going out and living a somewhat normal life, while they’re not ready to attend events or be with others. FOMO is self-driven, but it can increase anxiety, worries and uncertainty."</p>
        
        <span><b>So many unknowns … so much more to worry about</b></span>
        <p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, nearly one-third of Americans reported symptoms of anxiety and depression in June 2020—nearly double the rate prior to the pandemic. And a poll taken by the American Psychological Association shows the impact on Americans continues, as nearly half of all respondents said they felt “uneasy” about resuming in-person activities regardless of their vaccination status.</p>
        
        <p>“As we examine more people going back to ‘normal’ society, the anxiety is unknown—so uncertainty continues,” Dr. Fox said. “This level of confusion because of so many unknowns can enhance levels of anxiety if unaddressed. The more you think about the future and the uncertainties and unpredictability, the more anxious you’re going to be.”</p>
        
        <span><b>Tips to overcome FOMO and social isolation</b></span>
        <p>As you continue to navigate the ever-changing world, Dr. Fox shares a few things you can do to support yourself through it and minimize your FOMO.</p>
        
        <span><b>Focus on gratitude</b></span>
        <p>While FOMO is all about what others have, take a step back and focus on all that you have. Research shows an attitude of gratitude doesn’t just make you happier, it also lowers stress levels and improves well-being.</p>
        
        <p>“Instead of focusing on all that the pandemic has taken away or what others are doing and you’re missing out on, acknowledge some things that have been beneficial and positive in your life,” Dr. Fox said. “During the pandemic, you’ve been given more time with family, and maybe you’ve eliminated mundane tasks like commuting to an office. There’s so much to be grateful for.”</p>
        
        <p>Feeling a little stuck in the positivity department? Check out “Promoting Positivity with Gratitude” for helpful tips on how to get started.</p>
        
        <span><b>Go at your own pace</b></span>
        <p>You may not be ready for dinner with friends at your favorite restaurant, but that doesn’t mean you have to miss out. Invite them to your house or backyard and order in instead. Then, eventually, when you’re comfortable, you can try meeting friends outdoors at the restaurant.</p>
        
        <p>“Make decisions that feel right for you,” Dr. Fox said. “Slowly pushing yourself back into normal life can be beneficial for your mental, physical and emotional well-being.”</p>
        
        <span><b>Practice being in the moment</b></span>
        <p>A great way to help calm anxiety is to ground yourself in the present moment. Some ways you can do this are through meditation, deep breathing or simply walk down the street and take a moment to notice the details around you. This will allow you to bring your thoughts to the present moment and focus on the here and now. Not comfortable with the whole meditation thing? No problem. There are plenty of great apps out there (Calm, Headspace, Insight Timer) that can help you calm your mind and bring you into a more mindful, present state.</p>
        
        <span><b>Limit news and social media</b></span>
        <p>Even though FOMO is common, social media usage can make it surge. And, watching, reading or listening to the news constantly all day every day isn’t helpful either. Be careful not to become a victim of information overload.</p>
        
        <p>Limit the time you spend on your social media and consuming news. And recognize when your usage impacts your health. “If you notice your heart racing and you’re getting anxious, put down your phone, turn off the TV and take a walk,” Dr. Fox said.</p>
        
        <span><b>Have patience</b></span>
        <p>It’s okay to not feel okay all the time … especially right now. As we work back toward a social life, even the most extroverted people may find their energy zapped after a social engagement.</p>
        
        <p>“It takes more energy than it used to, so if you’re feeling burnt out, it’s okay to take a breather or break from being social,” Dr. Fox said. “It’s not all or nothing. Take small steps. If you need a mental break, stay home—recenter and refocus before you get back out there again.”</p>
        
        <span><b>If you’re in a FOMO funk, talk to your doctor</b></span>
        <p>Millions are experiencing post-pandemic anxiety, depression, apprehension and fear, but there are ways you can manage them. If the steps you’re taking aren’t working, it may be time to talk to your doctor or a licensed behavioral health specialist. They can help you identify what is triggering your symptoms and help you create an action plan to tackle them.</p>`,

    text: `<p>When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, it sent most office workers scurrying home. What we thought might be a few weeks of working from our bedrooms and dining rooms turned into more than a year. In that time, we’ve brightened our lipstick for Zoom meetings, gotten comfortable in our sweatpants and negotiated quiet, productive hours—or at least minutes—with our families.</p>

        <p>Now, vaccination rates are climbing, and employers are eyeing a post-pandemic future that looks different. Some want everyone back in the office every day. Some are staying with all remote work, all the time. And some fall in the middle—they want some people in the office, some of the time.</p>
        
        <p>Whatever your workplace decides, you’ll have to negotiate that transition. Divya Singh, MD, a psychiatrist at Banner Behavioral Health Hospital in Scottsdale, shares some tips on how to thrive in the new normal at work.</p>
        
        <span><b>Expect some stressors if you return to the workplace</b></span>
        <p>You’ve probably been home for a long time and rebuilding your routines might not be easy. Maybe you don’t feel comfortable taking public transportation yet. Maybe all that in-person time with your co-workers feels like a lot. Maybe your home life crept into your work life and it’s hard to return to the old ways.</p>
        
        <p>You might face some pandemic-related stressors, as well. Do you need to wear a mask all day at work? Have you become accustomed to Zoom, where you can see faces? How can you hold socially distanced meetings?</p>
        
        <p>To ease your return-to-work stress, Dr. Singh recommends that you:</p>
        
        <p>Talk to your colleagues and supervisors. No one knows your specific situation better than the people who share it. Tell them what’s challenging for you and ask if they’ve shared that problem. They can tell you what has worked for them.
        Know what pandemic precautions are recommended. Your workplace might require masks and social distancing, conduct temperature checks, expect certain cleaning and disinfecting processes to be followed, or have new guidelines for using shared meeting spaces, kitchens and restrooms. Knowing what to expect can make the transition smoother.</p>
        
        <span><b>Expect some stressors if you continue to work from home</b></span>
        <p>Even if you’ve come up with a good at-home work routine and you’re sticking with it, as the pandemic lifts, you’re likely to see changes. Maybe some of your colleagues return to work, and meetings where everyone is on Zoom shift to conference calls where some people are together in the same room and others are remote. Maybe you work from home, but you venture out to clients’ businesses sometimes. Maybe you need to go into the office occasionally and you don’t have a desk there that’s “yours” anymore.</p>
        
        <p>If you’re working from home, Dr. Singh recommends that you:</p>
        
        <p>Build in opportunities for social connection, especially if some people are returning to the office. Chat with your coworkers by phone, text or Zoom outside of regular meetings. “That can give everybody a chance to process their stress,” Dr. Singh said.
        Take breaks to interact with your family if they are at home. “Even a few minutes can make a difference,” Dr. Singh said.
        Try to mimic an in-office workday, especially as more people return to work and start keeping more regular working hours. Close down your computer at the end of the workday and shift to “home” time.</p>
        
        <span><b>Be flexible in these workplace transitions</b></span>
        <p>Dr. Singh points out that something might not be ideal, but it could still be worth trying. “Remember, just because something is not the same as before doesn’t mean it’s zero,” he said. “You might have to improvise—it’s not life as usual.”</p>
        
        <p>He reminds us to practice the healthy lifestyle habits we all know we should follow:</p>
        
        <li>Eat healthy</li>
        <li>Exercise</li>
        <li>Give yourself down time</li>
        <li>Spend time with your friends and family</li>
        <p>“We’re living in a challenging period, and managing stress, whether in-person or virtually, is physically and mentally taxing,” he said. “If we don’t take care of ourselves, at the end of the day we’re not going to be able to function at work or at home.”</p>

    text: `<p>Let’s talk about quercetin. Maybe you’ve heard it mentioned in discussions about cancer or COVID-19.  This natural ingredient can help your overall health. But how much, exactly?</p>

        <p>We talked to Bryan Kuhn, PharmD, a poison education specialist at Banner Poison & Drug Information Center, about what quercetin is, what it can treat and what it can’t treat. Like many natural ingredients, quercetin can be helpful but ultimately has its limits.</p>
        
        <span><b>What is Quercetin?</b></span>
        <p>Quercetin is in a class of metabolites known as “flavonoids,” a natural ingredient that can be found in many different fruits, vegetables and plants. Here’s where you’ll find it:</p>
        
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Berries</li>
        <li>Grapes</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Shallots</li>
        <li>Capers</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Honeys</li>
        <li>Seeds</li>
        <li>Nuts</li>
        <li>Flowers</li>
        <li>Barks</li>
        <li>Leaves</li>
        <li>Wines</li>
        <li>Teas</li>
        <br>
        <p>Basically, if you consume a lot of organic foods that sprout from the earth, you’ll get a lot of quercetin. In countries like Spain, where the cuisine is heavy in fruits and vegetables, people have shown high daily intakes of quercetin. (Mediterranean diet, anyone?) Quercetin is also available in medicinal botanicals like ginkgo biloba, and as a dietary supplement.</p>
        
        <span><b>How Does Quercetin Work?</b></span>
        <p>As a flavonoid, quercetin is also an antioxidant. And antioxidants like quercetin attack “free radicals,” or unstable atoms in your cells that cause illness and aging.</p>
        
        <p>Ailments usually cause inflammation, and antioxidants can decrease this inflammation — but antioxidants by themselves don’t cure inflammation, Dr. Kuhn said. Ibuprofen can be just as (or more) effective in treating inflammation and have more predictable results.</p>
        
        <p>“Antioxidants work in concert with many other elements of your diet, but antioxidants alone may not be as effective,” he explained. Quercetin and other antioxidants are simply part of a healthy diet.</p>
        
        <p>According to the National Library of Medicine’s quercetin summary, “Extracts of quercetin have been used to treat or prevent diverse conditions including cardiovascular disease, hypercholesterolemia, rheumatic diseases, infections and cancer but have not been shown to be effective in clinical trials for any medical condition.”</p>
        
        <p>Currently, there’s no data to support that high dosages of quercetin (500-1000mg daily) will protect you any better than a healthy diet would. (And yes, there is such a thing as too many vitamins.)</p>
        
        <span><b>Be Careful, and Be Realistic</b></span>
        <p>As with any supplement, consult your physician or pharmacist before taking quercetin supplements, Dr. Kuhn advised. These supplements can interact with your other medications or existing conditions, perhaps in ways you don’t expect.</p>
        
        <p>Also note: Quercetin by itself doesn’t prevent coronavirus transmission or its serious side effects. One of COVID-19’s most dangerous side effects is severe inflammatory pneumonia, so excessive inflammation is a big risk factor. Because of this, substances that reduce inflammation can be helpful overall. While quercetin is becoming a subject of more COVID-19 research, there’s no evidence yet to confirm or even suggest that it cures or prevents COVID-19. </p>`,

    text: `<p>If you or someone close to you has experienced a stroke, you know that they can happen suddenly and with little warning. Understanding the risk factors is the best way to prevent strokes from ever happening. 85% of strokes are ischemic strokes, which are caused by a clog in an artery, leading to a lack of blood flow to the brain. Obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol, heart arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, smoking, drug abuse and many other risk factors are all linked to an increased likelihood. Now, recent studies have shown that COVID-19 may be linked to increased stroke risk as well.</p>

        <p>Mohamed Teleb, MD, is medical director of neurosciences at Banner Desert Medical Center. He shared insight into how COVID-19 could increase your risk for strokes.</p>
        
        <span><b>How does COVID-19 increase risk of stroke?</b></span>
        <p>Common symptoms of moderate to severe COVID-19 include inflammation, poor organ function and development of blood clots. All of these symptoms and others are common for severe COVID-19 cases and could increase your risk of venous and arterial thromboembolisms, a build-up of blood clots which can subsequently lead to heart attack and stroke.</p>
        
        <p>“Not only does COVID-19 infection create inflammation throughout the body, but it has also been known to produce hypercoagulation of the blood (a condition that causes your blood to clot more easily than normal),” said Dr. Teleb. “This combination is particularly dangerous in the production of strokes.</p>
        
        <span><b>Who is at most at risk?</b></span>
        <p>People who have multiple risk factors for stroke have greater cause for concern during COVID-19 infection. In fact, moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms alone can create enough risk for doctors to recommend blood thinners to hospitalized patients. In general, if you aren’t normally at risk for stroke and if your COVID-19 symptoms are minor, the risk of stroke in this situation could be low.</p>
        
        <span><b>Is risk still high after COVID-19 recovery?</b></span>
        <p>“We are still collecting information,” said Dr. Teleb. “And we will be for years. It’s obvious that risk for stroke is higher during and immediately after recovery. But long-term effects related to stroke will take longer to verify.” What we do know is that rapid and early detection of stroke symptoms as well as understanding the subtle warning signs and symptoms of a stroke is vital. Remember to B.E. F.A.S.T.</p>
        
        <p>Balance: Sudden loss of balance or coordination.
        Eye: Sudden trouble seeing out of one or both eyes.
        Face: Is the face drooping or is it numb? When you smile, is it uneven or lop-sided?
        Arm Weakness: Is one arm weak or numb? Raise both arms – does one drift down?
        Speech: Is speech slurred? Is the person unable to speak or difficult to understand when asked to repeat a simple sentence?
        Time to call 9-1-1: If any of these symptoms are present, even if they go away, it’s time to call 9-1-1 and get to a hospital immediately.
        Don’t avoid treatment</p>
        <p>Time is of the essence when it comes to treating and recovering from a stroke. For patients who are nervous or hesitant about going to the hospital during a pandemic or at any time, Dr. Teleb offered some advice. “Strokes can be treated if caught quickly. Getting treatment at the hospital increases the doctors’ chances of minimizing or even reversing the long-term effects of your stroke.”</p>
        
        <p>Reduce your risk by getting help. If you are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, keep a close eye on your symptoms. Reach out to a doctor if they worsen. If you have other risk factors for stroke, discuss them with your doctor and make a plan for recovery.

    text: `<p>COVID-19 cases are dropping across the nation, but for many people, there’s still a high risk of getting infected. If you’re diagnosed with COVID-19 and you’re at high risk for developing a severe case, you could qualify for monoclonal antibody treatment (mAb).</p>

        <p>Monoclonal antibody treatment has been authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat mild to moderate COVID-19. “This treatment can help your body clear the COVID-19 virus more quickly and may reduce your symptoms,” said Emily Richards, a medication use specialist with Banner Pharmacy Services in Phoenix. “The monoclonal antibody binds to the COVID-19 virus and may prevent it from attacking more human cells and from spreading in your body.”</p>
        
        <p>In clinical trials, only 2% of people who received monoclonal antibody therapy developed severe symptoms or needed to be hospitalized, compared to 7% who did not receive the treatment.</p>
        
        <span><b>Do I qualify for monoclonal antibody treatment?</b></span>
        <p>To qualify, you need to be at least 12 years old and have mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms that began less than 10 days ago. Plus, you need to be at high risk for developing severe symptoms or requiring hospitalization.</p>
        
        <p>The FDA recently expanded its list of risk factors, and you’re considered high risk if you are pregnant, older (for example, over age 65) or if you have:</p>
        
        <li>Obesity (for example, body mass index or BMI above 25)</li>
        <li>Chronic kidney disease</li>
        <li>Diabetes</li>
        <li>Immunosuppressive disease, or you’re receiving immunosuppressive treatment</li>
        <li>Cardiovascular disease</li>
        <li>Hypertension</li>
        <li>Chronic lung disease such as COPD or cystic fibrosis</li>
        <li>Sickle cell disease</li>
        <li>Neurodevelopmental disorders or other medically complex conditions such as genetic conditions or metabolic syndrome</li>
        <li>Medical-related technology dependence such as a feeding tube</li>
        <li>Other medical conditions or factors, such as race or ethnicity, can also put you at high risk for developing severe COVID-19 infection. Your doctor can review your health history and risk factors and consider whether you qualify for the treatment.</li>
        
        <p>If you are diagnosed with COVID-19 and have any of these other risk factors, consider starting monoclonal antibody treatment as soon as possible. “The treatment may be most effective when it’s given shortly after symptoms appear,” Richards said.</p>
        
        <span><b>How can I get monoclonal antibody treatment?</b></span>
        <p>You need a referral from your regular health care provider or an urgent care provider to receive treatment. If you are high risk and think you qualify for monoclonal antibody treatment, contact your health care provider to discuss your options and find an infusion center near you.</p>
        
        <span><b>How are monoclonal antibody treatments administered?</b></span>
        The treatment is infused into your veins and takes about 30 to 60 minutes. “Once you have received the monoclonal antibody treatment you stay in the infusion center for one hour for observation, to make sure you do not have any side effects,” Richards said.</p>
        
        <p>Possible side effects are fever, nausea, chills, fatigue, rash, or dizziness and they usually clear up soon after the medication is stopped.</p>
        
        <span><b>How much does monoclonal antibody treatment cost?</b></span>
        <p>There’s no direct charge for the medication itself—that’s covered through the federal government. Your health insurance might bill you for the cost of administering the treatment. When you schedule your appointment the infusion center can let you know if you will need to pay that cost.</p>
        
        <span><b>Can I get the COVID-19 vaccine if I’ve had monoclonal antibody treatment?</b></span>
        You can still be vaccinated, but you should wait at least 90 days after you receive the treatment. If you’ve already been vaccinated, you can still receive the monoclonal antibody treatment.</p>`,

        <p>As a parent, you want to do everything in your power to ensure your child is best prepared as they leave the confines of your home and into the hallowed halls of their elementary, middle or high school this year. While you go through your child’s back-to-school list to get them ready for the new school year, don’t forget to put their health on the list as well.</p>
        
        <p>Going back to school can be exciting and a bit nerve-wracking for kids (and their parents!). There’s a lot to think about these days and not just about who they’ll sit with at lunch. They’ll also want to be smart on germs and viruses and how to remain healthy throughout the year, so they can continue to be their best selves.</p>
        
        <p>We spoke with expert Meghan Fels, DO, a pediatrician with Banner Health Clinic in Greeley, CO, who shared some of the top things parents can do to help their kids keep germs from spreading and ensure a great start to the school year.</p>
        
        <p>Tips to keep your child healthy this school year</p>
        
        <span><b>1. Practice healthy hygiene habits</b></span>
        <p>“First get down to the basics and discuss with your child the importance of good hygiene and simple ways they can help stop unwanted germs and viruses from spreading,” Dr. Fels said.</p>
        
        <p>Here are some things you can practice together:</p>
        
        <p>Master the vampire (or dab-like) sneeze move. Avoid sneezing in your hands (gross!) and instead practice sneezing in the bend of your elbow or even inside your shirt so sneeze droplets don’t circulate.
        Use one tissue each time and throw it away. Use a new tissue EVERY time you blow your nose, sneeze or catch any mucus, then throw the tissue away in a lined trashcan. No parent wants to see a trail of tissues in their child’s room, nor does a teacher want to see them littering their classroom.</p>
        <p>Wash hands often with soap and water. Wash your hands often, especially after blowing your nose or coughing. The best way to wash your hands is to use warm water and soap and to rub your hands together for a full 20 seconds. “It can help to sing a favorite song, your ABCs or happy birthday a couple times to make sure you’re getting the full 20 seconds,” Dr. Fels said. “If handwashing isn’t possible though, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer."</p>
        <p>Avoid touching your face. It’s estimated people touch their faces at least 23 times per hour (ew!). To help prevent infections, keep your hands away from your eyes, nose and mouth, especially during COVID-19 and flu season. Why? Because your mucous membranes are the perfect entry for gross germs that cause respiratory infections.
        Avoid sharing crayons, markers and scissors in class. While we’ve often heard, “sharing is caring,” it can also spread germs. If they have to share supplies, make sure your child knows to wash their hands when they are done.</p>
        
        <span><b>2. Eat a well-balanced diet</b></span>
        <p>Whether a preschooler or a senior in high school, children should eat a well-balanced diet to stay healthy—that means, fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains and lean proteins. Teach your kids to eat “the rainbow” and try a new color each week. Colorful fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamins, antioxidants and immune-fighting substances.</p>
        
        <p>If your child is vegetarian, dairy-free or has an erratic diet, you may wonder if they should take vitamins to boost their health. While they can help, vitamins aren’t always necessary.</p>
        
        <p>“Certain vitamins, like vitamin D, have been shown to be beneficial in preventing respiratory infection and protecting your immune system, but if you’re eating a well-balanced diet, you don’t need additional vitamins,” Dr. Fels said. “If your child doesn’t get enough vitamin D through foods, you can supplement. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends 600 IU a day for children over the age of 1.”</p>
        
        <span><b>3. Stay hydrated</b></span>
        <p>When it comes to your child staying healthy, hydration needs to be a big part. “When children get dehydrated, it can lead to headaches, lightheadedness, sleepiness and poor learning,” Dr. Fels said.</p>
        
        <p>Dr. Fels shared a breakdown on how much your child should drink each day:<p>
        
        <li>1 to 3 years old – about 3 to 4 cups of milk and water</li>
        <li>4 to 7 years old – about 5 cups of milk and water</li>
        <li>8 and older – about 8 cups of milk and water</li>
        <p>Go shopping together and find a water bottle that your child likes to carry and keep at their desk throughout the day. If water isn’t their thing, sweeten it with a slice of fruit, like pineapple, to add flavor.</p>
        
        <span><b>4. Get plenty of sleep</b></span>
        <p>“Sleep is the foundation for growth, learning and play,” Dr. Fels said. “It can restore our bodies and minds. And kids who get adequate sleep can have a healthier immune system, better school performance and have been shown to have better memory performance and improved mental health.”</p>
        
        <p>Check out this helpful article about the number of hours of sleep your child should be getting each night. If your child is having difficulty with sleep, speak with their health care provider to look for underlying concerns or conditions and come up with a sleep plan.</p>
        
        <span><b>5. Stay home when sick</b></span>
        <p>Another important way to limit the spread of germs and viruses is to stay home when you don’t feel well. Monitor your child every morning before going to school to see how they are doing and feeling.</p>
        
        <p>“There are multiple conditions including viral respiratory infections, viral stomach bugs, strep throat and pneumonia that can present similarly,” Dr. Fels said. “If your child is too ill to go to school, don’t force them to go—even if there isn’t a fever.”</p>
        
        <p>If they are showing any of the following signs, keep them home from school and call their health care provider if there is no improvement of symptoms:</p>
        
        <li>any fever of 100.4 or higher</li>
        <li>cough</li>
        <li>loss of taste or smell</li>
        <li>headache</li>
        <li>sore throat</li>
        <li>vomiting/diarrhea</li>
        <li>nasal congestion or runny nose that can’t be controlled</li>
        <li>a known exposure to an illness, such as COVID-19 (Follow CDC guidelines for quarantining)</li>
        
        <span><b>6. Stay up to date on vaccinations</b></span>
        <p>The best defense is a strong offense, and that’s why vaccinations are the best way to protect you, your children and others from illness. Check in with your child’s health care provider and make sure your child is up to date on all their immunizations or ask for the vaccination schedule.</p>
        
        <p>“It’s important to stay up to date on all immunizations, including meningitis, tetanus, measles, flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine, if eligible,” Dr. Fels said. “Vaccines not only help to prevent serious infection/hospitalization and death, but they also prevent the spread of illness at home to those who may be immunocompromised, at risk for infection complications and also to those in our community.”</p>`,

        <h5><b>What is coronavirus?</b> Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illness in humans and animals. Seven different types have been found in people, including those responsible for the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 epidemics.</h5>
        
        <h5>Early reports suggest the new virus is more contagious than the one causing SARS but less likely to cause severe symptoms. There is much we need to learn about the new coronavirus (COVID-19).</h5>
        <br>
        <h4>What are the types of coronavirus?</h4>
        <p>Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of viruses that cause respiratory and intestinal illnesses in humans and animals.They usually cause mild colds in people but the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in China in 2002–2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) on the Arabian Peninsula in 2012 show they can also cause severe disease.</p>
        <p>Since December 2019, the world has been battling another coronavirus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan, China, following reports of serious pneumonia.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>What do coronaviruses look like?</h4>
        <p>Coronaviruses are relatively simple structures, and their form helps us to understand how they work. They are spherical and coated with spikes of protein. These spikes help the virus bind to and infect healthy cells.</p>
        <p>However, the same spikes are also what allows the immune system to 'see' the virus. Bits of the spike can be used in potential coronavirus vaccines to prompt the body to produce antibodies against this new virus.</p>
        <p>They are named for the distinctive appearance of their spikes; when seen under a powerful microscope, the spikes look like a crown (corona is the Latin for ‘crown’). Beneath these spikes is a layer of membrane. This membrane can be disrupted by detergents and alcohols, which is why soap and water and alcohol hand sanitiser gels are effective against the virus.</p>
        <p>Inside the membrane is the virus’ genetic material – its genome. Whereas the genomes of some viruses like chickenpox and smallpox are made of DNA like humans, those of coronaviruses are made of the closely related RNA. RNA viruses have small genomes which are subject to constant change.</p>
        <p>These changes, called mutations, help the virus adapt to and infect new host species. It is thought that the new COVID-19 likely originated from bats but it is not yet known whether mutations allowed this jump from animals to humans.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>What is different about the new coronavirus?</h4>
        <p>The new SARS-CoV-2, is most closely related to a group of SARS-CoVs found in humans, bats, pangolins and civets.</p>
        <p>Even though there are many similarities between the new COVID-19 and the virus that caused the SARS epidemic, there are also differences resulting from changes in their genomes. This includes how they are passed from one individual to another, and the differing symptoms of coronaviruses. Early reports suggest that the new coronavirus is more contagious than the virus that caused SARS but less likely to cause severe disease.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>How many coronaviruses are found in humans?</h4>
        <p>To date seven human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have been identified (see table below). Four of them are common; less high risk and typically cause only mild respiratory illnesses in healthy human adults. However, they contribute to a third of common cold infections and, in higher risk people with weak immune systems, they can cause long term, life-threatening illnesses.</p>
        <p>The other three (those causing MERS, SARS and COVID-19 cases) are known to cause more severe illness such as shortness of breath and even death. COVID-19 illness tends to be milder than SARS and MERS but more severe than disease caused by the four common coronaviruses.</p>
        <p>Because this virus is new, no-one has any immunity to it. This means it will potentially infect very large numbers of people. And even though the number of very severe cases is low in percentage terms, a small percentage of a very large number adds up to many people with acute illness.</p>
        <p>It is thought that all seven human coronaviruses might have been transmitted to humans from other animals. Those causing MERS, SARS and COVID-19 probably originated from bats. It is possible that the transfer of the new COVID-1 from its original host species to humans involved another animal species, such as the pangolin, as an intermediate host.</p>`,
